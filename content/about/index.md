# About Penn Libraries United

<div class="info-box">

**We are librarians, curators, developers, archivists, fellows, educators, scholars, makers, and above all, workers at Penn Libraries.**

<br>

On June 21, 2024, we filed to unionize with AFSCME DC 47(the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, District Council 47). We will join our fellow Penn Libraries colleagues in Local 590. By affiliating with AFSCME, we will be joining the union that represents the most cultural workers in the country.

With extremely strong support across the Penn Libraries, we have requested that Penn voluntarily recognize our incorporation into our union. We look forward to moving forward expeditiously and collaboratively into bargainingâ€”and into a new and exciting chapter in the history of the Penn Libraries.
