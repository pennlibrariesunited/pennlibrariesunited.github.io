# About Penn Libraries United

<div class="info-box">

**We are librarians, developers, archivists, fellows, educators, scholars, makers, and above all, workers at Penn Libraries.**

<br>

On June 21, 2024, we filed to unionize with AFSCME DC 47(the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, District Council 47). We will join our fellow Penn Libraries colleagues in Local 590. By affiliating with AFSCME, we will be joining the union that represents the most cultural workers in the country.

On October 23, 2024, we were officially certified with the NLRB, and we are currently in the process of negotiating our first contract.
